## Introduction
<br>
When it comes to sports I prefer the kind where you kick a ball rather than throw it. But in this project prompted to me by the wonderful [Data Career Jumpstart Bootcamp](https://www.datacareerjumpstart.com/), I wasn't hired to be a data analyst for AFC Richmond, but the Utah Jazz, a basketball team!
<br>
## About the Data Set
<br>
The data comes from [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_totals.html). It's a summary of player stats data from the NBA 2021-2022 season. The full glossary can be found below:
<br>

</ul>
<br>
_*This statistic adjusts for the fact that a 3-point field goal is worth one more point than a 2-point field goal_
