## Introduction

The set up for this project is that I'm a fresh, new data analyst intern for IBM in their human resources department. The overall goal of my tasks are to answer the questions posed to me by management and use **[R](https://www.r-project.org/)** and **[R Studio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)**, a popular IDE, to do so.

## About The Data

The data for this project can be found **[here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)**. It's a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.

## Analysis

The first step in my analysis after loading in my csv file is answering the question if any of the demographics data [correlate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation). This can be done quickly and easiliy in R with the [cor](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/cor) function. To pass only the data from the columns I want to analyze I'll use [indexing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-select-dataframe-columns-by-index-in-r/#) and create a new dataframe. The final command used is shown in Figure 1.
