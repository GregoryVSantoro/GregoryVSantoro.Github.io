Describing how I used SQL commands to analyze the IDA dataset, which provides information on loans, grants, and guarantees provided by the IDA to member countries. Sharing several key insights, including the total number of transactions, loans issued to Nicaragua, the largest transaction recorded, and the average interest rate for loans issued. All to demonstrate that SQL is a powerful tool for extracting insights from large datasets.

In this case study from Data Analytics Accelerator, I was prompted to analyze an iFood (Brazilian equivalent to DoorDash) customer data. The main focuses were:
What were the ages of the customers?
How much does a customer spend relative to their income?
How does income level influence the total amount spent in the app?
