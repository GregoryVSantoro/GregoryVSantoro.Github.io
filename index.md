Here I analyzed an educational dataset to determine if there were any correlations between average class size and percentage of students accepted into college, if economic status has anything to do with that, and identifying underperforming schools.

In this case study from Data Analytics Accelerator, I was prompted to analyze an iFood (Brazilian equivalent to DoorDash) customer data. The main focuses were:
What were the ages of the customers?
How much does a customer spend relative to their income?
How does income level influence the total amount spent in the app?
