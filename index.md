In this case study from Data Analytics Accelerator, I was prompted to analyze an iFood (Brazilian equivalent to DoorDash) customer data. The main focuses were:
What were the ages of the customers?
How much does a customer spend relative to their income?
How does income level influence the total amount spent in the app?
